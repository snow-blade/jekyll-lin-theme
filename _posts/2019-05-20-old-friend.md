Past demons <br>
coming to haunt me after so long, <br>
this old venom <br>
that  I created using my tongue. <br>
 <br>
I face you, you my past mistakes <br>
you, you say you are me but youâ€™re fake <br>
you, you are  putting my life at stake <br>
because I created you when I was weak <br>
 <br>
It is now way too late to regret, <br>
to forgive and to forget. <br>
I deliberatedly created you <br>
and now I have to assume you. <br>
 <br>
The bad decisions I made now are hunting me as a pest, <br>
I have already become old and all I want is to rest. <br>
But there is no rest for the wicked <br>
and no glory for the weak. <br>
