Past demons
coming to haunt me after so long,
this old venom
that  I created using my tongue.

I face you, you my past mistakes
you, you say you are me but youâ€™re fake
you, you are  putting my life at stake
because I created you when I was weak

It is now way too late to regret,
to forgive and to forget.
I deliberatedly created you
and now I have to assume you.

The bad decisions I made now are hunting me as a pest,
I have already become old and all I want is to rest.
But there is no rest for the wicked
and no glory for the weak.
