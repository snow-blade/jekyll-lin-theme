Under the bright luster of the sun<br>
With no birds chirping, just sounds of distant a gun.<br>
I, the eternal vagabond, wander through the vast forest<br>
of Kibira, trying to my best to harness the heat of the west and travel east.<br>
<br>
In my travel from Karuzi to Bujumbura,<br>
As I travel through the wilderness and the flora,<br>
I reflect on the challenges I have to overcome to reach the legendary city<br>
That some know as the city or vanity and others as the one for opportunity.<br>
However, the war around me is depriving me of my sanity!<br>
Oh God! Please have mercy and pity!<br>
And help me reach this town in safety.<br>
<br>
However, the heat keeps increasing and my pace decreasing.<br>
My body is slowly decaying and the hunger in my stomach is slowly killing<br>
me. Slowly, I feel my body becoming weak.<br>
However, through a creek, I see the a view that is majestic.<br>
I crossed the county, I am now on the mountains overlooking my destination.<br>
Even though I still felt exhaustion,<br>
I was relieved to have reached the capital.<br>
Hopefully, my life will take a new canal.<br>
