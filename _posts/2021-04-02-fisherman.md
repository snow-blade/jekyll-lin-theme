<br>
On a lonely and sandy coast in the west<br>
resided an old fisherman who always wore a coat with no vest<br>
and went fishing daily in his small boat with no crest<br>
He didn't like to boast,<br>
but he knew he was the best fisherman in this post.<br>
As not a single day could go past<br>
without the fisherman getting fishes in quantities quite vast.<br>
<br>
One day, on a tuesday morning<br>
when the seas started roaring<br>
and the old man saw himself roaming<br>
on the boat, ramming<br>
to get it ashore<br>
before him and the vessel were no more.<br>
<br>
In a desperate attempt to stabilize the ship<br>
before the hits of water that came as a hip<br>
could make him lose his grip<br>
he cut the mast and the mainsail was shredded as he rip it<br>
and with pure will and grit,<br>
he managed to avoid getting swept adrift.<br>
<br>
After the waters calmed a bit<br>
he took out a almost-wet cigarette and lit it.<br>
He smoked, alone in the vast sea of infinite depth<br>
as he pondered on how he just avoided death.<br>
