A cowboy enters the saloon, <br>
and on his face, he displayed a sinister gloom.<br>
The gang leader suddenly became pale,<br>
as in him he saw his doom.<br>
He tried to hide but to no avail.<br>
Behind him, he heard a boom,<br>
and his body fell onto the floor of the room.<br>
<br>
The room suddenly became silent,<br>
the mood was becoming violent.<br>
Every man in the room rose on his toe,<br>
and the cowboy on the door became their common foe.<br>
<br>
The whole assembly pointed their guns at the unknown cowboy,<br>
but he remained unfazed as though he was staring  at a boy<br>
playing around with his new toy.<br>
<br>
The first shot rang as he lept out,<br>
the man's abilities were no joke without a doubt,<br>
and he kept smoking as he fought,<br>
his expression showed as though he didn't care if he got caught.<br>
<br>
He jumped on his horse with magnificent agility,<br>
as he barely avoided the bullets with unparalleled mobility.<br>
<br>
Some lucky fellas managed to mount their horses<br>
and they pursued him with half of their total forces.<br>
A rough guy was charging a gantling gun,<br>
but the unknown cowboy had turned his head and smiled as though he was having fun.<br>
By the time the gun was charged at full capacity,<br>
the cowboy had left the outskirts of the city.<br> 


Hello.<br>
